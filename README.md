<h2> ENCS5342-Natural-Language-Processing-Book-Recommendation-System</h2>
</br> 

our project focuses on developing a recommender system that suggests books to users based on their preferences. By incorporating collaborative filtering techniques, we analyze user ratings and interactions with books to identify patterns and similarities between users. This enables us to recommend books to users based on the preferences and behaviors of others with similar tastes.
